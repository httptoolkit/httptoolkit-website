      title: 'What happens if my payment fails?',
      text: "If a subscription renewal fails to go through, you'll lose access to paid features.

Once a retried payment goes through, your subscription will continue as normal.\n\nWhilst your subscription is failing to renew like this, the Settings page in the app will remain available, and you can update your payment method there, or cancel your subscription entirely if you'd prefer.",

      title: 'I would like a refund',
      text: "If you've subscribed to HTTP Toolkit but it doesn't work for you, or if you've been billed incorrectly (e.g. if you've renewed unintentionally or accidentally subscribed twice) please get in touch with [billing@httptoolkit.com](mailto:billing@httptoolkit.com) to explain the situation and request a refund. In general, refunds are available within 30 days of payment for all reasonable requests.",
