Want to know more about HTTP Toolkit subscriptions? Take a look at the FAQ below, and feel free to [get in touch](/contact/) if you have any other questions.

## Payments

### What are the subscription options?

There are two types of HTTP Toolkit account subscriptions: Pro & Team (see [Accounts](#accounts) below for the full details on the differences).

You can pay either monthly or annually. For either subscription period you can cancel at any time, and the subscription will continue as normal until the end of the paid period.

### What payment methods are available?

The payment methods available depend on your region.

Credit cards and PayPal are available for all purchases globally, but in specific regions it's also possible to pay with iDEAL, Giropay, WebMoney, Boleto Bancario, Alipay, Real-time Bank Transfer, CarteBleue, Sofort, MrCash, EPS, Przelewy24, Multibanco-SIBS, Trustly, MercadoPago, ToditoCash, Finnish Online Banking, DragonPay, AmBank, CIMB Clicks, Hong Leong Bank Transfer, Maybank2U, OP-Pohjola, Nordea, Danske, UnionPay, Konbini, WeChat Pay, ApplePay, Pix, Mach Pay, OXXO, and PagoEfectivo.

The available methods will be shown automatically during the checkout when you've selected your country. If your preferred payment method is listed above but isn't available during the checkout, please [get in touch](/contact/) as it may be possible to process this manually.

On request it's also possible to pay by purchase order (PO) and wire transfer, for payments over $1,000, but please note that this may entail delays and additional charges.

### Can I get a trial?

There's no trial option available, however you can use all the core features for free, and it's very easy to subscribe for a single month of Pro access as a taster. To do so, simply sign up for a monthly subscription, and then cancel immediately (see the next point).

### How can I manage my subscription?

For common actions like updating billing details or cancelling your subscription (see the next section) it's possible to do this from the 'Settings' page within HTTP Toolkit.

For full control of your account, including access to all historical invoices and to add & remove members from your Team subscription, please log into [accounts.httptoolkit.tech](https://accounts.httptoolkit.tech/) to manage your subscription in the online dashboard.

### How can I cancel?

You can cancel your HTTP Toolkit subscription either within the app itself, or via the online [account management dashboard](https://accounts.httptoolkit.tech/).

#### Cancelling from the HTTP Toolkit app

1. Open HTTP Toolkit, and log in with your Pro account (if you haven't already).
2. Go to "Settings" in the bottom left.
3. Click "Cancel Subscription".
4. Confirm the cancellation in the window that appears.

#### Cancelling on the web

1. Open [accounts.httptoolkit.tech](https://accounts.httptoolkit.tech/) in your browser
2. Enter the email that you used to sign up (you can check the email address that receives your invoices to confirm this).
3. Enter the code that will be sent to your email to complete your login.
4. Click "Cancel Subscription".
5. Confirm the cancellation in the window that appears.

Cancelled accounts remain active & usable for the previously paid period, and then expire without renewal.

Your cancellation should be processed within a few seconds, and you'll receive an email to your account's registered email address to confirm once this is complete.

### Who are Paddle & PayPro?

HTTP Toolkit's order process is conducted by two online resellers: <a href="https://paddle.com">Paddle</a> and <a href="https://payproglobal.com/">PayPro Global</a> (depending on the region). These resellers act as the "Merchants of Record" for all orders. In effect, they're the legal sellers of HTTP Toolkit subscriptions, and they handle payment processing, most of the required accounting, all customer service related to invoicing, billing, and so on.

Both companies are large & reputable payment providers, who handle payments for 1000s of other software businesses, including tools like [Framer](https://www.framer.com/), [AnyChart](https://www.anychart.com/) and [Wallaby.js](https://wallabyjs.com/).

### Why am I being charged sales tax?

By default you'll be charged sales tax on your transaction, according to the rules on digital purchases in your local jurisdiction.

If you're purchasing on behalf of a VAT/GST-registered business you may not need to pay this, and you can enter your VAT/GST id during the checkout to have that removed.

If you forget to do so, you can also reply to the invoice you receive from Paddle/PayPro, provide your registered ID, and ask them to retroactively refund the sales tax.

### What happens if my payment fails?

If a subscription renewal fails to go through, you'll lose access to paid features. The subscription payment will be retried once immediately, then 3 days later, then 7 days later, and then your subscription will be cancelled. Once a retried payment goes through, your subscription will continue as normal.

Whilst your subscription is failing to renew like this, the Settings page in the app will remain available, and you can update your payment method there, or cancel your subscription entirely if you'd prefer.

### I would like a refund

If you've subscribed to HTTP Toolkit but it doesn't work for you, or if you've been billed incorrectly (e.g. if you've renewed unintentionally or accidentally subscribed twice) please get in touch with billing@httptoolkit.com to explain the situation and request a refund. In general, refunds are available within 30 days of payment for all reasonable requests.

## Accounts

### How do Pro accounts work?

Pro accounts give you access to all paid features, from import/export of intercepted traffic & rewriting rules to advanced configuration options.

Your Pro account can be used on as many devices as you like, by logging into each device separately.

The account is permanently linked to a single individual - the primary user of the registered email address - and must not be shared or transferred. If it's clear that an account is being shared between multiple users then your account may be terminated (although we'll always get in touch with you about this first).

### How do Team accounts work?

Team accounts provide a group of people access to all paid features. They simplify group account management and billing, and allow transfer of licenses between individuals, as users leave and join the team.

With a Team subscription, rather than every team member signing up individually, managing their own Pro subscriptions and receiving their own invoices, one account owner can subscribe for many team members, and centrally pay and manage the team's account.

Each Team subscription includes a total number of licenses for use by individual team members. The subscription is linked to the email addresses of each user who should be included as a team member. Each of those users gets access to all paid features in the HTTP Toolkit app.

Whilst Pro accounts are permanently linked to an individual, Team licenses can be transferred between individuals, to add or remove members from the team. Each license can be transferred once every 48 hours.

Each team member counts towards the total number of licenses available. The account owner by default does not, and cannot access paid features other than subscription management, but can be included in the list of team members too if you'd like.

### How do I log into my account in the app?

In the app, click "Get Pro", then "Log into existing account", and log in with your registered email address.

### What's my account's password?

HTTP Toolkit accounts are passwordless. Instead of setting a password, when you log in with your email address you'll be asked for a 6-digit code, which will be sent to your email.

Codes are randomly generated, only the most recent code is valid, and codes expire after 15 minutes.

This avoids remembering & managing passwords, simplifies account setup, and remains just as secure as passwords, since anybody who can access your email could also use a "Forgot Password" link.
