## How do we keep your information safe?

We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.

Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.

## Do we collect information from minors?

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 13 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 13 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services.

If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the details below.

We will do our best to honor these signals where possible. As no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals on all platforms has been finalized, we cannot guarantee that these will be honored in 100% of cases. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
